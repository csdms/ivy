If there is a feature that terrainbento does not have that you are interested in, if you have a clarification question, or if you find an error, please make an [Issue on GitHub](https://github.com/TerrainBento/terrainbento/issues) so we can improve the package. \n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "terrainbento was designed to make it easy to create alternative models to be compared in Earth surface dynamics. The package has 28 model programs and a model base class that makes it possible to make additional models within the same framework. \n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest model, called Basic, evolves topography using stream power and linear diffusion. It has the following governing equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial \\eta}{\\partial t} = - KQ^{m}S^{n} + D\\nabla^2 \\eta$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "where $K$ and $D$ are constants, $Q$ is discharge, $S$ is local slope, and $\\eta$ is the topography. Other models modify Basic by adding or changing a process component and changing the governing equation. See the [model Basic documentation](https://terrainbento.readthedocs.io/en/latest/source/terrainbento.derived_models.model_basic.html) for additional information. "
