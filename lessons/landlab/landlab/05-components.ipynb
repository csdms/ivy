    "A \"potluck\" is a common American tradition in which each guest brings a dish to share. These contributed dishes usually come in one of a few categories: salads, drinks,  main dishes, desserts. The meal comes together as a collection of components, each of which contributes to fulfilling one of these basic roles. The resulting meal provides guests with a great variety of choices. A guest can compose their own complete and unique meal by combining their own choices for components. And each guest, while contributing their own particular dish, gets to share in the creations of their compatriots. There's a bit of standardization---the dishes are sized to fit on the tables, and their contents are accessible to the usual range of serving utensils---but with that standardization lies a great range of creativity.\n",
    "\n",
    "Component modeling is a bit like the potluck tradition: one can construct a complete simulation by assembling components to represent the different parts of the system to be modeled. In Landlab, a **component** is a semi-standardized Python *class* that represents a particular process or calculation. Components are not stand-alone programs, but rather are designed to be used within another Python program that creates an integrated model or workflow.\n",
