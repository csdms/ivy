The example is the erosional degradation of an earthquake fault scarp, and which evolves over time in response to the gradual downhill motion of soil. Here we use a simple \"geomorphic diffusion\" model for landform evolution, in which the downhill flow of soil is assumed to be proportional to the (downhill) gradient of the land surface multiplied by a transport coefficient.\n",

    "This example uses a finite-volume numerical solution to the 2D diffusion equation. The 2D diffusion equation in this case is derived as follows. Continuity of mass states that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla \\cdot \\mathbf{q}_s$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $z$ is elevation, $t$ is time, the vector $\\mathbf{q}_s$ is the volumetric soil transport rate per unit width, and $\\nabla$ is the divergence operator (here in two dimensions). (Note that we have omitted a porosity factor here; its effect will be subsumed in the transport coefficient). The sediment flux vector depends on the slope gradient:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\mathbf{q}_s = -D \\nabla z$,\n",
    "\n",
    "where $D$ is a transport-rate coefficient---sometimes called *hillslope diffusivity*---with dimensions of length squared per time. Combining the two, and assuming $D$ is uniform, we have a classical 2D diffusion equation:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{\\partial z}{\\partial t} = -\\nabla^2 z$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the numerical solution, we discretize $z$ at a series of *nodes* on a grid. The example in this notebook uses a Landlab *RasterModelGrid*, in which every interior node sits inside a cell of width $\\Delta x$, but we could alternatively have used any grid type that provides nodes, links, and cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The gradient and sediment flux vectors will be calculated at the *links* that connect each pair of adjacent nodes. These links correspond to the mid-points of the cell faces, and the values that we assign to links represent the gradients and fluxes, respectively, along the faces of the cells.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flux divergence, $\\nabla \\mathbf{q}_s$, will be calculated by summing, for every cell, the total volume inflows and outflows at each cell face, and dividing the resulting sum by the cell area. Note that for a regular, rectilinear grid, as we use in this example, this finite-volume method is equivalent to a finite-difference method.\n",
    "\n",
    "To advance the solution in time, we will use a simple explicit, forward-difference method. This solution scheme for a given node $i$ can be written:\n",
    "\n",
    "$\\frac{z_i^{t+1} - z_i^t}{\\Delta t} = -\\frac{1}{A_i} \\sum\\limits_{j=1}^{N_i} \\delta (l_{ij}) q_s (l_{ij}) \\lambda(l_{ij})$.\n",

The variable $\\delta(l_{ij})$ contains either +1 or -1: it is +1 if link $l_{ij}$ is oriented away from the node (in which case positive flux would represent material leaving its cell), or -1 if instead the link \"points\" into the cell (in which case positive flux means material is entering).\n",
    "\n",
    "To get the fluxes, we first calculate the *gradient*, $G$, at each link, $k$:\n",
    "\n",
    "$G(k) = \\frac{z(H_k) - z(T_k)}{L_k}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here $H_k$ refers the *head node* associated with link $k$, $T_k$ is the *tail node* associated with link $k$. Each link has a direction: from the tail node to the head node. The length of link $k$ is $L_k$ (equal to $\\Delta x$ is a regular uniform grid). What the above equation says is that the gradient in $z$ associated with each link is simply the difference in $z$ value between its two endpoint nodes, divided by the distance between them. The gradient is positive when the value at the head node (the \"tip\" of the link) is greater than the value at the tail node, and vice versa.\n",
    "\n",
    "The calculation of gradients in $z$ at the links is accomplished with the `calc_grad_at_link` function. The sediment fluxes are then calculated by multiplying the link gradients by $-D$. Once the fluxes at links have been established, the `calc_flux_div_at_node` function performs the summation of fluxes."

The horizontal coordinate perpendicular to the profile is $y$. Assume that at any time, the hillslope is perfectly symmetrical in the $y$ direction, and that there is no flow of soil in this direction.\n",

The width of the column in the $y$ direction is $W$. The height of the column, $z$, is also the height of the land surface at that location.
