    "\n",

    "... to use the same diffusion model in 2D instead of 1D.\n",

    "... to use an irregular grid (in 1 or 2D). \n",
    "\n",
    "... wanted to combine the diffusion model with a more complex model. \n",

    "... have a more complex model you want to use over and over again with different boundary conditions.\n",

    "These are the sorts of problems that Landlab was designed to solve. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Part 1 we will use the RasterModelGrid, fields, and a numerical utility for calculating flux divergence. \n",
    "\n",
    "Landlab is often times associated with terrestrial processes. But the library provides a very rich ecosystem to tackle all kind of geophysical problems (other than the 'land'). To showcase this, we will solve the same advection and diffusion equations we solved before, but this time in 2 dimensions and using the landlab toolkit to build a model.  "
