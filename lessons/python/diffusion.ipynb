While many could only watch the crisis unfolding in hotels and airports, photographer Ragnar Th.

The volcano itself is situated at 2220 km from the left boundary of the simulation domain. Brussels is situated at 4220 km from the left boundary of the simulation domain. Choose a spatial resolution of 20 km. In the next couple of steps, you will calculate the time required to obtain a specific ash concentration above Brussels. \n",
