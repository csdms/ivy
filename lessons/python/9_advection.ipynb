    "\n",
    "- **What is advection?** Advection is a transport mechanism of a substance or conserved property by a fluid due to the fluid's bulk motion (Wallace and Hobbs, 2006).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Examples:**  What can be advected: temperature, moisture, aerosols, ...\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Why discretise?** Because not for all solutions the analytical solution is known, in fact, most of the time it is not known. Especially in the field of earth sciences where sets of simultaneous, nonlinear, partial differential equations has to be solved using known analytical methods. To solve such coupled equations, numerical computational methods are required to discretize and solve the PDE's on a lattice. In this notebook, we will only deal with a finite difference scheme, using the simplest form of a truncated Taylor series expansion. Many alternative methods are available to solve PDE's. Nevertheless, many models in geosciences use finite difference methods, because of their conceptual simplicity and ease of coding (Prof. N. Van Lipzig)."

    "where $C$ is the aerosol concentration and $v$ is a constant windspeed at which aerosol concentrations are advected. The equation above is a prototype of an **initial value problem**: The solution is obtained by using the known initial values and marching or advancing in time. The solution of this equation can be obtained directly from the initial conditions:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ C(x,t) = C(x-vt,0) \\label{eq:2}\\tag{2}$$\n",

To capture such a positive flow, the upwind discretisation scheme uses the info from the neighbouring node in the upwind direction, that is, the node to the left, indicated by j-1 on the sketch.
