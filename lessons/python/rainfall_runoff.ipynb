    "One of the principal applications of hydrology is in the forecasting and prediction of flood peaks and runoff volumes due to large rain and snowmelt events. To do this, researchers use models that simulate the stream response to a water-input event of a given magnitude and spatial and temporal distribution on a drainage basin. These models are usually referred to as rainfall-runoff models.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rainfall-runoff models include empirical models, conceptual models, and physically based models. These models are used to generate design floods or forecast floods from actual storms. A design flood is used in the design of bridges, levees, or floodplain-management plans. Flood forecasting is the process of predicting the occurrence, magnitude, timing, and duration of floods in a specific area. It is usually done via complex hydrologic models that are varying degrees physically based.\n",

    "## SCS Curve-Number Method\n",
    "One of the most widely used rainfall-runoff models for routine design purposes is the SCS Curve-Number method. This method was developed by the U.S. **S**oil **C**onservation **S**ervice (now the U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service, NRCS). In this method, there are three basic computations: 1) estimation of the effective rainfall, 2) estimation of the peak discharge, and 3) estimation of the runoff hydrograph."
