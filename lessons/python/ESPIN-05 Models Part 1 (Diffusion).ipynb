    "### Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "The diffusion equation can be used to represent a great deal of natural\n",
    "and environmental processes. It was introduced by Fourier in 1822 to\n",
    "calculate the distribution of the temperature in materials and has later\n",
    "been applied by Fick to material science. The mathematical expression\n",
    "that we will derive can be used to model e.g. heat transfer in the\n",
    "earth's crust, soil evolution, transport of contaminant in an aquifer or\n",
    "in the atmosphere, erosion of mountain ranges, the evolution of glaciers\n",
    "and many other phenomena. But before describing the equation directly,\n",
    "we will investigate what diffusion actually means.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note: Lecture notes on diffusion are partly based on Prof. Dr. Frédéric Herman's course on geophysical processes. \n",

    "#### Diffusion, what does it mean? \n",
    "The following movie illustrates Brownian motion, we can\n",
    "see that the equation to derive for diffusion must enable us to\n",
    "represent the movement of molecules from a high concentration zone to a\n",

    "concentration zone to a zone of low concentration due to random\n",
    "processes. C represents the concentration; X is the horizontal distance\n",
    "and q is the net particle flow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Due to diffusion, the particles move from the black zone to the grey\n",
    "zone. This can be explained by the fact that each particle can move at\n",
    "any moment in any direction, over a given distance. In one dimension, a\n",
    "particle can move to the left or to the right with equal probability,\n",
    "and this as well in the gray region as the black region. However, at the\n",
    "transition from the black zone to the grey zone, the probability of\n",
    "seeing particles move from left to right is much larger than the\n",
    "opposite (because there are much more black particles). This causes a\n",
    "particle transfer that depends on the difference of concentration $\\Delta C$ and\n",
    "the distance that the particle must travel $\\Delta x$, where $\\Delta C$ is the\n",
    "difference of concentration in a transition zone of length $\\Delta x$.\n",
    "Therefore, we can see that the flow of particles (i.e. the number of\n",
    "particles passing through per unit surface and time (in 2D, mol m<sup>-1</sup>\n",

    "In the previous exercise, we modeled a particle transfer assuming a random particle shift. The solution showed that the change in particle distribution depends on the concentration difference $\\Delta C$ and the distance the particle must travel $\\Delta x$, where $\\Delta C$ is the difference in concentration in the transition zone of length $\\Delta x$ (Figure 2).\n",
    "\n",
    "From these observations, we can thus conclude that particle flow, i.e. the number of particles passing through the side of an infinitesimal block per unit of time $\\mathrm{(mol \\: m^{-1} s^{-1})}$, will depend on the concentration gradient (Figure 2).\n",

The diffusion coefficient will vary from one problem to another and defines the speed of particle transfer. Now, we would also like to know how the *concentration* changes during the calculations. Let's take an infinitesimal block with an incoming flow, and an outgoing flow (Figure 4).\n",
