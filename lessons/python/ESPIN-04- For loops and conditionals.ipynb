The first time around, `length` is zero (the value assigned to it on line 1) and `letter` is \"e\". The code adds 1 to the old value of `length`, producing 1, and updates `length` to refer to that new value. The next time the loop starts, `letter` is \"l\" and `length` is 1, so `length` is updated to 2. Once there are no characters left in \"elephant\" for Python to assign to `letter`, the loop finishes and the `print` statement tells us the final value of length.\n",
