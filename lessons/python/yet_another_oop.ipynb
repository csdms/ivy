    "We think about half of Greenland's contribution to sea level rise comes from ice discharge. The rate at which ice flows depends on its temperature in two pretty important ways: (1) warmer ice tends to be softer, and thus deforms faster, and (2) warm temperatures at the bed allow ice to slide more rapidly. On longer time scales, this also means that warm-bedded glaciers are much more efficient agents of erosion and sediment transport. We can usually measure the temperature at the surface of the ice sheet, but it's rare that we get to measure the temperature inside the ice. So, it's great opportunity to put together a simple numerical model to give us a prediction to work off of.\n",
