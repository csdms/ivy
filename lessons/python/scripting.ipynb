But, as you might have noticed by now, notebooks are pretty slow, especially when we start to run programs with hundreds or thousands of lines of code. \n",

    "A *terminal* is a text interface that allows a user to communicate with the operating system. We have a few different examples of terminals:\n",
    "- JupyterLab's Terminal app\n",
    "- Linux terminal or xterm\n",

    "A *shell* is the software responsible for interpreting your instructions. The most common shell is Bash (Bourne Again SHell). If you're on a Unix-based OS (Mac or Linux), you'll have Bash installed natively. If you're on Windows, you can get it through Git for Windows, which includes Git Bash.\n",
    "\n",
    "The fundamental action in a terminal is a REPL: Read, Evaluate, Print Loop. First, we have to type something. Try typing <tt>pwd</tt>, to print the current working directory. When you hit enter, the shell:\n",

    "2. Evaluates the command. \n",

    "### Exercise 4) Include a main() function.\n",
    "Now, what you've just done works perfectly well for one-off scripts. But, when we talk later about modules and packages, you'll see some cases where it might be advantageous to separate out the *definitions* from the *actions* in a script. For example, you might want to write some new code that pulls in the functions you defined in this script, but doesn't go ahead and make all of the plots or actually run the model. This is such a common use case that Python has a special syntax for handling it.\n",
    "\n",
    "At the bottom of your script, write the following code:\n",
    "\n",
    "<tt> \n",
    "if __name__ == '__main__':\n",
    "</tt>\n",
    "\n",
    "This chunk of code checks for two reserved keywords in Python: *\\_\\_name\\_\\_* and *\\_\\_main\\_\\_*. Basically, \\_\\_name\\_\\_ is the name of the current module, and \\_\\_main\\_\\_ is the name of the current program being run. When you run a script using <tt>python3 foo.py</tt>, then *foo* is both \\_\\_name\\_\\_ and \\_\\_main\\_\\_. So, it will run everything you have defined in that *if* block. But, if you instead import something from <tt>foo.py</tt> into <tt>bar.py</tt> and run <tt>bar.py</tt>, then \\_\\_name\\_\\_ is *foo* but \\_\\_main\\_\\_ is *bar*, so the code inside the *if* block won't run.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this exercise, separate out the *definitions* in your script from the *actions*. Leave the definitions above, but move the actions (running the model and plotting figures) into a protected *if* block, using the syntax from above.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Exercise 5) Import a function into a new script.\n",
    "Now we have a great setup for reusing our code! Make a new script in the same directory as your old one. At the top of the script include an import statement that looks like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<tt>\n",
    "from my_script import my_function\n",
    "</tt>\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that you shouldn't include any of the file extensions here. For the rest of this exercise, build out the second script to use the functions you defined previously. Try a few new ideas (check out the additional exercises for inspiration), so you can get used to modifying your scripts, running them, and checking the output."
