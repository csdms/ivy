    "## The 2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcano eruption\n",
    "\n",
    "> On 14 April 2010 a subglacial explosive eruption started in Eyjafjallajökull, situated on the south-central coast of Iceland. This was a medium‐size eruption but due to the explosive nature and the prevailing winds during that first week, the ash was advected southeastward into the crowded air space of the UK and continental Europe. This caused major disruptions of air traffic. Volcanic eruptions are not uncommon in Iceland but the Eyjafjallajökull eruption has shown different characteristics than usually expected. Instead of peaking during the first few days and then gradually decreasing, the eruption had an explosive phase 14–17 April with mainly tephra and ash production, and a phase of mainly lava production 18–30 April before becoming explosive again. This meant that a continuous reevaluation of the strength of the eruption and the production of tephra and ash was necessary. Because the winds carried the ash a short distance overland, only a small part of Iceland, about 3\\% , was badly affected by ash fall. However, the rural community in the vicinity of the volcano that experienced the worst ash fall is also facing problems with drifting ash.\n",

    "\n",
    "We want to simulate the spread of ash aerosols over Iceland and the rest of Europe from the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in its explosive phase. Special attention is given to the ash concentration in Brussels. Aerosols are tracer elements transported through the atmosphere that can be modeled as an advection-diffusion system. Note that this exercise is a simplified version of reality: the parameter values and concentrations are arbitrary chosen for the purpose of demonstrating the [advection-diffusion equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convection%E2%80%93diffusion_equation)."
