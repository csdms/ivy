    "In the first lesson we used NumPy arrays to manipulate topographic data. NumPy arrays are not built into Python: we had to import the library `numpy` in order to be able to use them. These data structures are the most useful for scientific computing because the allow us to easily do math on our data. For anyone who's programmed in Matlab or C before, these are also the most familiar data structure (which is why we introduce them first!).\n",

    "One of the built-in data structures that you will definitely use extensively in Python is the list. Because they are built in, we don't need to load a library to use them. A list is exactly what it sounds like -- **a sequence of things that don't all have to be the same type**. Lists are ordered, so we can access the items through an integer index (like we did with NumPy arrays), and one list can simultaneously contain numbers, strings, other lists, numpy arrays, and even commands to run.\n",
