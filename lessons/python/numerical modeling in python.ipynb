    "## The 2010 Eyjafjallajökull volcano eruption\n",
    "“On 14 April 2010 a subglacial explosive eruption started Eyjafjallajökull, situated on the southcentral coast of Iceland. This was a medium‐size eruption but due to the explosive nature and the prevailing winds during that first week, the ash was advected southeastward into the crowded air space of the UK and continental Europe. This caused major disruptions of air traffic. Volcanic eruptions are not uncommon in Iceland but the Eyjafjallajökull eruption has shown different characteristics than usually expected. Instead of peaking during the first few days and then gradually decreasing, the eruption had an explosive phase 14–17 April with mainly tephra and ash production, and a phase of mainly lava production 18–30 April before becoming explosive again. This meant that a continuous reevaluation of the strength of the eruption and the production of tephra and ash was necessary. Because the winds carried the ash a short distance overland, only a small part of Iceland, about 3\\% , was badly affected by ash fall. However, the rural community in the vicinity of the volcano that experienced the worst ash fall is also facing problems with drifting ash.\" Guðrún Nína Petersen; Copyright © 2010 Royal Meteorological Society \n",

    "## Goal\n",
    "Your goal for today and tomorrow will be to simulate the amount of ash aerosols (ppm) over Iceland and the rest of Europe, produced by the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in its explosive phase. Special attention will be given to the ash concentration in Brussels. Aerosols are tracer elements, transported by the wind and can be modeled as an advection diffusion system. In this exercise, the units of aerosols are parts per million (ppm). Note that this exercise is a simplified version of reality: used parameter values and concentrations are all arbitrary and merely picked for the purpose of demonstrating the advection (also referred to as convection) diffusion equation. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Topics\n",
    "Before we dive into the solution of the advection-diffusion problem posed by the volcanic eruption, we need to cover some basic python programming skills. We only touch on some basic principles and concepts. For a more complete introduction, check out [this manual ](https://physics.nyu.edu/pine/pymanual/html/chap1/chap1_intro.html). \n",
