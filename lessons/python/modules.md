# Modules, scripts, and the basics of packaging

Jupyter Notebooks can get you a long way,
but to really advance your scientific programming skills,
you'll need to write Python source code in a *module*.
Code from a module can be imported
into an interactive Python session, a notebook, or even other modules,
just as we can with NumPy or Matplotlib functions.
Code in a module can also be executed from a shell prompt as a *script*.
A group of modules can be bound together as a *package*.
Packages are the most effective way to share Python code.
Because packages can be installed into an environment,
path considerations aren't an issue.
Code from an installed package can be run at any location on a filesystem.
The NumPy and Matplotlib libraries are packages.

Let's start by creating a module
from the diffusion code we set up in the [functions](./functions.ipynb) lesson.

## Modules

A *module* is a file containing Python statements and definitions.
It uses the `.py` extension.
The module name is the filename.

Start by opening a terminal and making a new directory `ivy_diffusion`,
in your home directory.
```
$ mkdir ~/ivy_diffusion
```

Change info this directory
and start a new module file `solver.py`.
```
$ cd ~/ivy_diffusion
$ touch solver.py
```

Your directory structure should look like this:
```
ivy_diffusion
└── solver.py
```

Next,
open `solver.py` in a text editor.
Copy all of the imports and functions from the [functions](./functions.ipynb) notebook
into `solver.py`.

The result should look something like this:
~~~
"""A solver for the one-dimensional diffusion equation."""
import numpy as np

np.set_printoptions(precision=1, floatmode="fixed")


def calculate_time_step(grid_spacing, diffusivity):
    return grid_spacing**2 / diffusivity / 2.1


def set_initial_profile(domain_size=100, boundary_left=500, boundary_right=0):
    concentration = np.empty(domain_size)
    concentration[: int(domain_size / 2)] = boundary_left
    concentration[int(domain_size / 2) :] = boundary_right
    return concentration


def solve1d(concentration, grid_spacing=1.0, time_step=1.0, diffusivity=1.0):
    """Solve the one-dimensional diffusion equation with fixed boundary conditions.

    Parameters
    ----------
    concentration : ndarray
        The quantity being diffused.
    grid_spacing : float (optional)
        Distance between grid nodes.
    time_step : float (optional)
        Time step.
    diffusivity : float (optional)
        Diffusivity.

    Returns
    -------
    result : ndarray
        The concentration after a time step.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> import numpy as np
    >>> from solver import solve1d
    >>> z = np.zeros(5)
    >>> z[2] = 5
    >>> solve1d(z, diffusivity=0.25)
    array([   0.0,    1.2,    2.5,    1.2,    0.0])
    """
    flux = -diffusivity * np.diff(concentration) / grid_spacing
    concentration[1:-1] -= time_step * np.diff(flux) / grid_spacing


def diffusion_example():
    """An example of using `solve1d` in a diffusion problem."""
    print(diffusion_example.__doc__)
    D = 100  # diffusivity
    Lx = 10  # domain length
    dx = 0.5  # grid spacing

    dt = calculate_time_step(dx, D)
    C = set_initial_profile(Lx)

    print("Time = 0\n", C)
    for t in range(1, 5):
        solve1d(C, dx, dt, D)
        print(f"Time = {t*dt:.4f}\n", C)
~~~
(You can instead copy/paste the above, if you wish.)

By convention,
imports are listed at the beginning of the module,
and there are two blank lines between definitions.
One extra decoration--a module docstring--has been added at the top of the file.

Before continuing,
be sure to save the file `solver.py` in your text editor.

Also, because we'll need NumPy in the next few sections,
make sure you're in an environment that has it installed, such as `ivy`.
```
$ source activate ivy
```

### Scripts

With a text editor,
add the following code to the bottom of module file `solver.py`.
~~~
if __name__ == "__main__":
    diffusion_example()
~~~
This is an example of a *main program*.

Calling the `solver` module from a shell prompt as a *script*
executes the main program.
```
$ python solver.py
An example of using `solve1d` in a diffusion problem.
Time = 0
 [500.0 500.0 500.0 500.0 500.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0]
Time = 0.0012
 [500.0 500.0 500.0 500.0 261.9 238.1   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0]
Time = 0.0024
 [500.0 500.0 500.0 386.6 363.9 136.1 113.4   0.0   0.0   0.0]
Time = 0.0036
 [500.0 500.0 446.0 429.8 266.2 233.8  70.2  54.0   0.0   0.0]
Time = 0.0048
 [500.0 474.3 464.0 359.6 328.7 171.3 140.4  36.0  25.7   0.0]
```

Scripts are typically used to run an example that demonstrates the code in a module,
but they're also just a handy way to execute Python code.

### Importing code from a module

We can import code from `solver.py` into a Python session.
Let's try three different cases.

### Import from current directory

From your `ivy_diffusion` directory,
start a Python session
and attempt to import the `solve1d` function from the `solver` module.
```
>>> from solver import solve1d
>>> solve1d
<function solve1d at 0x105845300>
```
We successfully imported the function.
Exit the Python session (`Ctrl-D` or `exit()`).

### Import from parent directory

Next,
change to your home directory
and start another Python session.
Again,
try to import the `solve1d` function.
```
>>> from ivy_diffusion.solver import solve1d
>>> solve1d
<function solve1d at 0x103495300>
```
This also works.
Exit the Python session (`Ctrl-D` or `exit()`).

### Import from arbitrary directory

Last,
change to an arbitrary location on your filesystem;
e.g.,
```
mkdir -p ~/tmp && cd ~/tmp
```
Start a Python session and try to import the `solve1d` function.
```
>>> from ..ivy_diffusion.solver import solve1d
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
ImportError: attempted relative import with no known parent package
```
Look at the error message:
because of the change in path,
there's no way to get to the `solver` module.
Exit the Python session.

One way to address this problem is by modifying Python's path,
but this isn't a good idea because it's not portable and it doesn't scale well.

A better solution is packaging.

## Packaging

A *package* is a group of Python modules.
Packages can be installed into a Python distribution or environment
so that they're automatically included in Python's path,
thereby making them accessible anywhere on a filesystem.

Let's create a package for the `solver.py` module.

Start by configuring a directory structure for the package.
```
$ mkdir ~/ivy-diffusion && cd ~/ivy-diffusion
$ mv ~/ivy_diffusion .
$ touch pyproject.toml
```
Note the hyphen in the top directory, `ivy-diffusion`.
The resulting directory structure should look like this:
```
ivy-diffusion
├── pyproject.toml
└── ivy_diffusion
    └── solver.py
```
This is the bare minimum set of files required to build a package.
(As an aside,
this directory structure is also ready to become a `git` repository.)

The `pyproject.toml` file is a configuration file
that contains information used to build the package.
Here, we'll use a very simple `pyproject.toml` file.
With a text editor,
copy/paste the following into your `pyproject.toml` file.
~~~
[build-system]
requires = [
    "setuptools",
    "wheel",
    ]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"

[project]
name = "ivy-diffusion"
version = "0.1"
dependencies = [
    "numpy",
]
~~~
The information we've added configures the build system
and gives a name and an initial version to our project.
It also specifies that the NumPy library is required.
For more information on setting up a `pyproject.toml` file,
see the Python Packaging Authority (PyPA)
[tutorial](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) and
[sample project](https://github.com/pypa/sampleproject).

Last,
use the package installer for Python, `pip`,
to install the `ivy-diffusion` package into the current environment.
```
pip install -e .
```
More information on `pip` can be found in its [documentation](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/).

Once the package is installed,
you can start a Python interpreter from anywhere on your file system
and import definitions from the packaged `solver` module.
```
>>> from ivy_diffusion.solver import solve1d, diffusion_example
>>> diffusion_example()
An example of using `solve1d` in a diffusion problem.
Time = 0
 [500.0 500.0 500.0 500.0 500.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0]
Time = 0.0012
 [500.0 500.0 500.0 500.0 261.9 238.1   0.0   0.0   0.0   0.0]
Time = 0.0024
 [500.0 500.0 500.0 386.6 363.9 136.1 113.4   0.0   0.0   0.0]
Time = 0.0036
 [500.0 500.0 446.0 429.8 266.2 233.8  70.2  54.0   0.0   0.0]
Time = 0.0048
 [500.0 474.3 464.0 359.6 328.7 171.3 140.4  36.0  25.7   0.0]
```

## Summary

The [Modules](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/modules.html) section
of the Python documentation was used to write this lesson.

While this lesson introduces the basics of packaging,
there's much more to learn,
and the best place to look for more information
is the PyPA's [Python Packaging User Guide](https://packaging.python.org/).
