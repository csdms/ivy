# The shell, in brief

This introduction to the shell
is designed to run on [EarthscapeHub](https://csdms.colorado.edu/wiki/JupyterHub).

## Files and directories

Information on a computer is stored in files and directories.
The part of an operating system that handles this information
is called the *file system*.
Think of the file system as a tree with branches (directories) and leaves (files).

Let's find out where we are in the file system when we start a terminal:
```
$ pwd
/home/jupyter-mpiper
```

The `pwd` command prints the current directory to the terminal.
You can see that I'm in the directory `jupyter-mpiper` under the directory `home`.
The forward slash `/` is used as a delimiter between directory names.

The string "/home/jupyter-mpiper" is called a *path*.
Think of a path as directions used to get to a location on the file system.
This path is an example of an *absolute path*
because it starts at "/", the *root* of the file system.

The directory `/home/jupyter-mpiper` is special--it's the *home directory*
of the user `jupyter-mpiper`.
Every user has a home directory.
It's the default location for you to create and store information.

Note that I executed this command on a JupyterHub running Linux;
the home directory on a macOS or Windows machine will be slightly different.

## Directory listings

Next, let's look at the contents of user `jupyter-mpiper`'s home directory:
```
$ ls
CoCoLessons  bin          bmi-topography  ivy       scratch
README.md    bmi-geotiff  data            projects  tmp
```

The `ls` command provides a directory listing.
This home directory holds a set of files and directories.

We can drill down through directories by providing arguments to `ls`.
For example, to see the contents of the **ivy** directory, type:
```
$ ls ivy
AUTHORS.rst          CONTRIBUTING.rst  README.md              lessons     pytest.ini
CITATION.cff         LICENSE.md        environment.unix.yaml  media
CODE-OF-CONDUCT.rst  README.ipynb      environment.yaml       noxfile.py
```

You can see that the CSDMS Ivy lesson files
have been added to the JupyterHub.
We can drill further; for example,
to see into the directory containing lessons, type:
```
$ ls ivy/lessons
best-practices  conda    git  jupyter  permamodel  python           shell
bmi             editors  hpc  landlab  pymt        requirements.in
```

## Changing directories

Although we've peered into the directory of Ivy files,
we remain in the home directory.
To change directories, use the `cd` command:
```
$ cd ivy
$ pwd
/home/jupyter-mpiper/ivy
```

The `pwd` command shows that we've switched to the **ivy** directory.

The `cd` command can take a directory name as an argument.
It can also take no arguments:
```
$ cd
$ pwd
/home/jupyter-mpiper
```

With no arguments, `cd` always returns to your home directory.

The `cd` command can also take a set of special characters as arguments.
To switch to the previous directory, use a dash `-`:
```
$ cd -
/home/jupyter-mpiper/ivy
```

When working with directories, a dot `.` is a shortcut for the current directory,
while two dots `..` are a shortcut for the *parent directory*,
one directory closer to the root of the file system:
```
$ cd .
$ pwd
/home/jupyter-mpiper/ivy
$ cd ..
$ pwd
/home/jupyter-mpiper
```

Likewise, the tilde `~` is a shortcut for the user's home directory:
```
$ cd ~
$ pwd
/home/jupyter-mpiper
```

## Making a directory

From your home directory, use the `mkdir` command to make a new directory:
```
$ mkdir new
$ ls
CoCoLessons  bin          bmi-topography  ivy  projects  tmp
README.md    bmi-geotiff  data            new  scratch
```

Change to the new directory and get a listing:
```
$ cd new
$ ls
```

The new directory is empty.

## Copying, moving, and removing

Let's copy a file from the **ivy** directory to our **new** directory:
```
$ cp ../ivy/README.md .
$ ls
README.md
```

Here, we instructed the `cp` command to go up a directory and over to the
**ivy** directory to get a file and copy it to the current directory.
In this example,
the arguments to `cp` are both *relative paths*
because their starting points are relative
to the current directory on the file system.

Note that the copy and the original both exist, and are the same:
```
$ $ diff -s README.md ../ivy/README.md
Files README.md and ../ivy/README.md are identical
```

The `diff` command compares files and reports how they differ.

The `mv` command can be used to rename a file.
```
$ mv README.md readme.md
$ ls
readme.md
```

The `mv` command can also be used to move a file from one location to another.
Let's move **readme.md** up to the home directory:
```
$ mv readme.md ~
$ ls
$ ls ~
CoCoLessons  bin          bmi-topography  ivy  projects   scratch
README.md    bmi-geotiff  data            new  readme.md  tmp
```

Note that the **new** directory is now empty because **readme.md** has been
moved to the home directory.
Also note that **README.md** and **readme.md** in the home directory are
different files!
The file systems in Linux and macOS are case-sensitive.

## Viewing files

We've seen how to manipulate the names and locations of files.
How can we see what's *in* a file?

There are several shell tools available to do this.
The simplest is `cat`,
which prints the contents of the file to the screen.
For example, try:
```
$ cat readme.md
```
(The output is long, so we've chosen to omit it here.)

Similar to `cat` are `head` and `tail`, which by default show the first and last 10 lines of a file:
```
$ head readme.md

Slightly more advanced are tools called "pagers"; `more` and `less` are examples.
A pager fills the screen with lines of text.
If there's more text than screen,
tap the `Space` key on your keyboard to advance to the next screen of text.
Use the `b` key to go back.
Use the `q` key to quit the pager.
Try this with:
```
$ more readme.md
```
Pagers are handy for stepping through large files one screen at a time.

How would we change the contents of a file?
That's a topic unto itself.
We'll visit it in a separate [lesson](../editors/index.md) on text editors.

## Deleting files and directories

Files can be deleted with the `rm` command.
Remove our **readme.md** file with:
```
$ cd
$ rm readme.md
```

There is no concept of a "trash" or "recycle" bin in the shell.
Once a file is removed, it's gone, irrevocably.

Directories are deleted with the `rmdir` command.
As a last step, let's delete the **new** directory:
```
$ rmdir new
$ ls
CoCoLessons  bin          bmi-topography  ivy     scratch
README.md    bmi-geotiff  data            projects  tmp
```

As `rm` removes files, the `rmdir` command removes directories.
However, the directory must be empty before it can be removed.
