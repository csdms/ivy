# Best Practices in Software Development

In this lesson, we'll discuss four topics
that fall under the category of *best practices*--software development techniques
that aren't required,
but have been found helpful and productivity-enhancing.
The topics:

* unit testing,
* continuous integration,
* collaboration techniques, and
* FAIR software

were selected because they're used on a near-daily basis at CSDMS
for the development and maintenance of our software,
and we believe they're helpful, in general,
for the work of ESP scientists.


*Learning objectives:*

* Understand unit testing concepts
* See how to write a unit test for `pytest`
* Understand continuous integration concepts
* Understand some recommended behaviors for working on collaborative projects
* See the FAIR principles of software development
