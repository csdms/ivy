# Best Practices in Software Development

In this lesson, we'll discuss three topics
that fall under the category of *best practices*--software development techniques
that aren't required,
but have been found helpful and productivity-enhancing.

The topics:

* unit testing,
* continuous integration, and
* collaboration techniques

were selected because they're used on a near-daily basis at CSDMS
for the development and maintenance of pymt and Landlab,
and we believe they're helpful, in general,
for the work of ESP scientists.


*Learning objectives:*

* Understand unit testing concepts
* See how to write a unit test for `pytest`
* Understand continuous integration concepts
* Understand some recommended behaviors for working on collaborative projects


## Topics

This lesson continues in the following sections.

1. [Unit testing with pytest](./unit-testing.md)
1. [Continuous integration with Travis CI](./continuous-integration.md)
1. [Collaborative projects ("Gitiquette")](./collaboration-etiquette.md)
