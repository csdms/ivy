# Anaconda and conda

One attribute of Python that makes it a great language for science
is its abundance of packages (numpy! scipy! pandas! xarray! pymt!).
Package management can be difficult, though,
especially when a typical Python installation contains dozens of packages.

This is where the `conda` *package manager* is handy,
and a primary reason why CSDMS uses (and we recommend)
the Anaconda Python distribution
(now called [Anaconda Individual Edition](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual)).

With `conda`, you can:

* list
* install
* update
* remove

packages from a Python installation.
`conda` ensures that the packages work together without conflict.

Because much of our work in ESPIn takes place
on the [CSDMS JupyterHub](https://csdms.rc.colorado.edu),
we don't spend much time on `conda` here;
however,
we recommend installing Anaconda on your computer
so that you can use all of the ESPIn course material locally.

Further,
to ensure you have all the correct packages needed to use the course material,
we ask that you set up an *environment*,
an independent Python installation managed by `conda`.
To do so,
we'll need an *environment file* from the ESPIn repository.

In the ["Getting things from elsewhere"](../shell/getting-things.md) section
of the shell lesson,
we downloaded the ESPIn repository as a zip archive and uncompressed it
in our **Desktop** directory.
In a terminal,
change to this directory and view the file **environment.yaml** with `cat`:
```
$ cd ~/Desktop/espin-main
$ cat environment.yaml
# A conda environment for ESPIn lessons.
#
# Usage:
#   $ conda env create --file=environment.yaml
#   $ source activate espin

name: espin
channels:
  - conda-forge
dependencies:
  - python =3
  - numpy
  - scipy
  - pandas
  - notebook
  - bmipy
  - pymt >=1.1
  - landlab >=2.0
```

The environment file lists all the packages needed to run the course material.
If a package has a dependency not listed
(e.g., `pymt` is built on `xarray`),
`conda` finds a compatible package version for you.

To create the environment, type:
```
$ conda env create --file=environment.yaml
```

Once the environment has been created, type
```
$ source activate espin
```
to make this environment current.

Later,
when finished using the environment, type
```
$ conda deactivate
```
to return to the base environment,
and
```
$ conda remove -n espin --all
```
to fully remove the environment from your Anaconda installation.


## Summary

While Python is installed with most operating systems,
or can be downloaded and installed from source,
CSDMS recommends the use of Anaconda
because of its `conda` package management system.

This table summarizes `conda` concepts covered in this section:

| Concept      | Description
| ------------ | -----------
| package manager | a tool for managing Python packages, ensuring compatibility
| environment  | an independent, isolated Python installation managed by `conda`
| environment file | a file specifying the packages that make a `conda` environment

This table summarizes the `conda` subcommands used in this section:

| Subcommand | Description
| ---------- | -----------
| list       | lists all packages installed in an environment
| create     | make a new environment from a file
| install    | adds a new package into an environment
| remove     | uninstalls a package from an environment
| update     | gets newer versions of packages in an environment

This table summarizes shell commands used in this section:

| Command      | Description
| ------------ | -----------
| source       | runs a script
