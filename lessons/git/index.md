# Introduction to version control with git and GitHub

In this lesson we'll learn about *version control*,
a process for tracking changes to files on a computer.
We'll use [git](https://git-scm.com/),
a free and open source distributed version control system,
and [GitHub](https://github.com/),
a company that provides hosting for software development and version control
built on `git`.

*Learning objectives:*

* Understand version control concepts
* Configure `git` and GitHub on a computer
* Understand basic `git` commands
* Get exposure to some intermediate/advanced `git` commands
* Know where to get help, or more information


## Why use version control?

Fundamentally,
version control is for tracking changes to files.
But this leads to much more.
Here are some examples...

* Back up your thesis -- Did you ever accidentally delete
  a thesis chapter? With version control, you can recover it!
* Save code -- whether it's a class assignment or a journal article figure,
  you never know when you might need it again.
* Get organized -- Keeping versions of programs (e.g., **flux1.py**,
  **flux2.py**, **flux2a.py**, **flux2a-1.py**, etc.) lying around can
  be confusing. Version control provides tools for structuring these
  versions.
* Explore without fear -- Version control can give you confidence to try
  new things, knowing that if you mess something up, you can always go
  back to a safe point.
* Share code -- A public repository can be searched and discovered by
  anyone, augmenting open science.
* Collaborate -- Work with other scientists on a research project,
  or on writing a proposal or paper.
* Time machine -- When your team uses version control, as team members
  move on, their work doesn't.
