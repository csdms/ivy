# CSDMS Ivy

CSDMS Ivy is a collection of instructional materials on

* modern, collaborative, scientific software development, and
* use of community cyberinfrastructure tools

for researchers in earth and planetary surface processes.

CSDMS Ivy is
written and maintained by the
[Community Surface Dynamics Modeling System ](https://csdms.colorado.edu)(CSDMS).

## Lessons

CSDMS Ivy lessons are modular and independent,
although the ordering below represents a typical progression.

1. [Project Jupyter][jupyter]
1. [Introduction to the Shell][shell]
1. [Text Editors and Development Environments][editors]
1. [Python Fundamentals][python]
1. [Anaconda and conda][conda]
1. [Version Control with git and GitHub][git]
1. [Python for Modeling][python]
1. [Landlab][landlab]
1. [The Basic Model Interface (BMI)][bmi]
1. [The Python Modeling Toolkit (pymt)][pymt]
1. [Permamodel Toolkit][permamodel]
1. [Introduction to Cluster Computing][hpc]
1. [Best Practices in Scientific Software Development][best-practices]

The lessons can be run locally
if a user installs Anaconda and a `git` client on their computer.
All lessons are also available to run
on [EarthscapeHub][jhub].
