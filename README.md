# ESPIn

The Earth Surface Processes Institute (ESPIn),
held 2021 June 8-17,
is an immersive online training experience
for 25 graduate students, postdoctoral fellows, and early career faculty.
ESPIn is designed to help participants make advances
in earth surface processes research
by teaching cyberinfrastructure skills in numerical modeling,
best programming practices, open source software development,
and collaborative coding.
